Here’s a draft of a README file for your app:

Hand Tracking Whiteboard App

This application is a dynamic and interactive hand-tracking whiteboard. It uses a combination of OpenCV, MediaPipe, and CMU Graphics to track hand gestures in real time and display corresponding visualizations on a virtual whiteboard.

Features

	•	Hand Tracking: Tracks the position of your hand in real time using a webcam.
	•	Gesture Recognition: Detects when the thumb and index finger are close together (gesture state: “write”) and draws circles on the whiteboard.
	•	Interactive Visualization: Displays a circle representing the hand’s position and visualizes the path when writing.
	•	Custom Background: Allows you to set a custom image as the whiteboard background.
	•	Real-Time Feedback: Updates the display dynamically to reflect hand movements.

Libraries and Imports

The application requires the following libraries:
	•	OpenCV (cv2): For webcam feed and video processing.
	•	MediaPipe (mediapipe): For robust hand-tracking and gesture detection.
	•	NumPy (numpy): For numerical operations on hand landmarks.
	•	Threading (threading): To run hand-tracking and visualization processes simultaneously.
	•	CMU Graphics: For rendering the interactive whiteboard interface.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install numpy

Additionally, make sure the cmu_graphics module is accessible in your environment.

How to Run the App

	1.	Clone or Download the repository containing the app’s source code.
	2.	Place the desired background image (background.jpg) in the same directory as the Python script.
	3.	Open the script in your Python IDE or terminal.
	4.	Run the app:

python <script_name>.py


	5.	Allow webcam access when prompted.

Usage

	•	Hand Position: Move your hand in front of the webcam to see the circle track your movements.
	•	Drawing Circles: Close your thumb and index finger to trigger the “write” gesture. Circles will appear on the whiteboard along your hand’s path.
	•	Custom Background: Replace background.jpg with your preferred image to personalize the whiteboard.

Notes

	•	Ensure your webcam is functional and accessible.
	•	For optimal tracking, use the app in a well-lit environment.
	•	Adjust the app’s window size in the runApp() function (e.g., width=1920, height=1080) to fit your display needs.

Future Enhancements

	•	Add more gestures for advanced interactions.
	•	Implement eraser functionality to clear specific areas of the whiteboard.
	•	Include multi-hand tracking for collaborative use.
